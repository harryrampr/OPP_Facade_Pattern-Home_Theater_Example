## Facade Pattern (OOP) - Home Theater Example

We are sharing some simple PHP code, showing the use of
the [Facade Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern). You will see how modern versions
of PHP, supporting Classes, make it easy to implement the Facade Pattern using this language.

You can find the PHP 8.1 code
at [/app/src](https://github.com/harryrampr/OPP_Facade_Pattern-Home_Theater_Example/tree/master/app/src), there is
testing at [/tests](https://github.com/harryrampr/OPP_Facade_Pattern-Home_Theater_Example/tree/master/app/tests)

### About the Pattern

The Facade Pattern is a design pattern
in [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) that provides a simplified
interface to a
complex
subsystem or set of classes. It aims to hide the complexities of the subsystem and present a unified and simplified
interface for client code to interact with.

The main purpose of the Facade Pattern is to improve usability and maintainability by reducing the dependencies and
interactions between client code and the subsystem. It encapsulates the subsystem's functionality behind a facade
object, which acts as a high-level interface. Client code interacts with the facade object without needing to know the
internal details or complexities of the subsystem.

### History

The Facade Pattern, also known as the "Facade," is a design pattern that was introduced by the "Gang of Four" (Erich
Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides) in their influential book, ["Design Patterns: Elements of
Reusable Object-Oriented Software"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns), published in 1994. The book aimed to
catalog and describe common design problems
and
their solutions in object-oriented programming.

The Facade Pattern itself has roots in the principles of software engineering and modular design. It is closely related
to the concept of abstraction and the principle of encapsulation, which advocate hiding complex details and providing
simplified interfaces.

### Intent

The Facade Pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, hiding its complexities and presenting a
unified interface for client code. It promotes [loose coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling),
encapsulation, and abstraction, improving the
usability
and maintainability of the system.

### Structure

- **Facade**: The facade object represents the simplified interface that clients interact with. It encapsulates the
  interactions with the subsystem and delegates requests to appropriate classes within the subsystem.
- **Subsystem**: The subsystem consists of multiple classes that encapsulate the complex functionality. These classes
  work together to fulfill the requests received from the facade.

### How it Works

1. The client interacts with the facade object, calling its methods to perform specific tasks.
2. The facade object receives the client's requests and delegates them to the appropriate classes within the subsystem.
3. The classes within the subsystem perform the necessary operations to fulfill the requests.
4. The facade object collects the results and returns them to the client.

### Benefits

- **Simplified Interface:** The Facade Pattern provides a simplified and intuitive interface, hiding the complexities of
  the subsystem.
- **Encapsulation:** The subsystem's internals are encapsulated behind the facade, keeping them hidden from clients and
  managing dependencies.
- **Reduced Coupling:** Clients only interact with the facade, reducing direct dependencies on the subsystem's classes.
- **Abstraction:** The facade provides a higher-level abstraction of the subsystem, focusing on commonly used
  functionality and shielding clients from implementation details.
- **Code Organization:** The pattern improves code organization by structuring the subsystem into smaller, cohesive
  units, with the facade acting as a central point of control and coordination.

### Applications

- **Simplified APIs and Libraries:** The Facade Pattern is often used to simplify complex APIs or libraries, providing a
  more user-friendly and intuitive interface. It hides the underlying complexity and exposes a streamlined set of
  methods that clients can easily interact with.
- **Integration with External Systems:** When integrating with external systems or services, the Facade Pattern can be
  employed to abstract away the intricacies of the integration process. It provides a unified interface that handles the
  necessary interactions with the external system, shielding client code from the implementation details.
- **Legacy System Wrapping:** When working with legacy systems, the Facade Pattern can be used to wrap and encapsulate
  the
  legacy code behind a facade. It allows clients to interact with a simplified interface, while the facade handles the
  necessary translation and communication with the underlying legacy system.
- **Complex Subsystem Management:** The Facade Pattern is beneficial when dealing with large and complex subsystems. It
  provides a high-level interface that coordinates interactions with multiple subsystem components. This simplifies the
  management and orchestration of the subsystem, allowing clients to interact with a single entry point.
- **Module or Library Initialization:** In scenarios where there are several steps involved in initializing a module or
  library, the Facade Pattern can be utilized to encapsulate and streamline the initialization process. The facade
  exposes a single method that takes care of initializing all the necessary components, making it easier for clients to
  bootstrap the module or library.
- **Service Aggregation:** When working with multiple services or microservices, the Facade Pattern can be applied to
  aggregate and provide a unified interface for clients. The facade abstracts the complexities of interacting with
  individual services and presents a simplified interface that clients can use to access the combined functionality.
- **Testing and Mocking:** The Facade Pattern can be useful in testing scenarios. By providing a facade with a
  simplified
  interface to a system, it becomes easier to write tests and mock the underlying subsystem. This allows for isolated
  testing of specific functionality without having to deal with the complexities of the complete system.

### Other Examples

An example of the Facade Pattern can be seen in a computer startup process. The facade object, such as a "
ComputerFacade," provides a simplified interface to start the computer. The facade internally coordinates the
interactions with various subsystems, such as the CPU, memory, and peripherals. The client simply calls a method on the
facade, abstracting away the complexities of the startup process.
